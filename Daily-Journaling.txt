1. Today I have learnt the basics of AWS 
Task 1:- I have create a virtual machine on AWS using linux AMI(Amazon machine image)
Task 2:- Then I have connected to that VM using bash and putty

Learning:- Using bash it was easy but using putty first you have to convert the format of the 
            private key then it can used.

Thats all for the day....
